\subsection{Hierarchical Dirichlet Process}

The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) is a non-parametric approach to topic models that utilizes similar underlying models to LDA. In fact, HDP can be considered an natural generalization of LDA with an unbound number of topics. The most important distinction of HDP to LDA (or LSA) is that the number of topics is not specified beforehand, but is instead learned from the data. This is achieved through utilizing nested Dirichlet processes - one for each document, with all processes sharing a common base distribution $H$, which is also drawn from a Dirichlet process\cite{HDPPaper}. \\\\
While HDP is referred to as a non-parametric method, some parameters actually do remain, which are parameters related to the different Dirichlet processes and distributions utilized by the model.
